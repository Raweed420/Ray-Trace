# Ray Tracing Sphere with PNG Output

This project is a simplified implementation of a ray tracing algorithm that generates an image of a sphere with shading and highlights. The code demonstrates the basic concepts of ray tracing, including ray-sphere intersection and basic lighting calculations.
This project also includes the ability to output the image in the PNG format using the lodepng library.

## Usage
The program will generate an output image file named "output.png" in the same directory as the executable. The image will be in the PNG format, representing the rendered scene with appropriate shading and highlights.

## Customization
The code includes several variables and constants that can be customized to modify the output image. These include the width and height of the image, sphere properties (center, radius), light source properties, and color definitions.

Feel free to experiment with different values to create different scenes and effects.
